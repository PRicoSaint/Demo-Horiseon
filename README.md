# Demo-Horiseon
Marketing Agency Horiseon is looking to streamline, improve and make their website more accessible. This project contains those improvements.
Changes were made to the html file but most were made to the CSS file. The Horiseon website itself is now more streamlined, better organized and meets their own goal for search engine optimization with alt attribute additions to each imgage.
A lot of the elements were consolidated, allowing for easier maintenance and changes in the future. In addition, notes were added to both the html and CSS file to better explain each section.
