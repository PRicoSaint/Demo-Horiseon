# **Horiseon Website**

####
# Short Summary of Project
## Marketing Agency Horiseon is looking to streamline, improve and make their website more accessible. This project contains those improvements.
## I made changes were made to the html file but most were made to the CSS file. The Horiseon website itself is now more streamlined, better organized and meets their own goal for search engine optimization with alt attribute additions to each image.
## A lot of the elements were consolidated, allowing for easier maintenance and changes in the future. In addition, notes were added to both the html and CSS file to better explain each section.

# Description of refactoring process
## I began by opening the page without making any changes and testing the functionality. I noticed that the link to "search engine optimization" was not working as required. I was able to fix this by referencing the location directly with an `id="search-engine-optimization"`. I did not find anything else out of order with the webpage. I then began delving in the html code and studying what I was looking at. I noticed the usage of a lot of div's with classes in the brackets. I noticed each of the images lacked `alt=""` to describe each one. I added alt attributes to each one. Next, I looked into the CSS and seeing how each class corresponded to their counterpart in the HTML. I noticed a lot of redundancy so I consolidated a lot of the class. In addition, I converted a lot of the classes to more general elements and this helped clean up the CSS code. I modified the HTML to match the new elements. 

## After completing various modifications and documenting the changes, I began adding descriptions to each section, describing what it was for, both in the HTML and CSS files.

## Finally, I deployed the website and tested it on different computers and displays.
